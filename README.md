# project-to-AI-context
A lightweight and language-agnostic tool that extracts the meaningful source code of any project into a clean, text-only format. It automatically skips build output, binaries, media files, and other noise, allowing you to easily provide a full project snapshot to LLMs or perform text-based analysis across an entire codebase.
